# To Do

## Movement

- [ ] configure sinewave oscillator.
- [ ] decide how to modulate the oscillator based on branch traits
  - vine width? Decrease amplitude
  - direction, one of the axes is freq

## Synth

- [x] create oscillator factory
  - [x] create oscillator
  - [x] create ui artifact that controls oscillator
  - [x] refactor power button to control local instance, rather than single global
- [x] control oscillator volume
- [x] control oscillator waveform
- [x] update gain when slider changed
- [x] BUG: creating multiple oscillators confuses each oscillator's toggle button
- [x] BUG: oscillator gain not set until clicking volume input
- [x] BUG: volume knobs have same problem as toggle buttons did
- [ ] create oscillator frequency interface
  - [x] create a frequency setter for oscMod
  - [ ] create input element for note frequencies

- [ ] create way to generate notes



- [ ] create patch mechanism

- [ ] do some css
