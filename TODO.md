# To Do

## DEMOS

### Movement

- [ ] configure sinewave oscillator.
- [ ] decide how to modulate the oscillator based on branch traits
  - vine width? Decrease amplitude
  - direction, one of the axes is freq

### Synth

- [x] BUG - connecting modules together fails with a console Error 
- [x] BUG - the main audio volume slider isn't hooked up properly
- [x] BUG - oscillator inits with value inconsistent with slider

- [ ] create lines that show what inputs/outputs are connected

- [ ] optimize oscillator css
  - [ ] oscillator elements organized in a nice box
  - [ ] good color scheme

- [ ] create way to generate notes
  - [ ] generates note frequenciess with math, rather than table lookup

- [ ] create module that alters input wave
  - envelope generator?
  - ASDR
