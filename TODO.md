# To Do

- [x] move squares in an arc
- [x] slow down animation
- [x] update background
- [ ] determine why animation gets slower. Are squares not getting dropped after they outgrow the frame?
- [ ] Slowly bring the planet in frame
- slowly move the color gradient to create dawn
- [ ] once the planet comes into 1/3 of the frame, rotate the rectangles, and move the planet across frame, giving hte impression of a roll.
- [ ] end the animation by having the ship achieve escape velocity
