        At one point in my life, I thought it would be cool to build a robot and earn a side income as a vlogger.
        I didn't really have much experience in either realm, so I spent most of my free time learning how to do whatever it was I needed to do at the time.

        And then I got a girlfriend. My priorities shifted away from this project after that for some reason.
        The videos make me cringe now, but I'm happy with the quality improvement from the first one to the last. 
        Sometimes it's the little victories.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have the robot. I keep thinking I'll work on it some day.
