        <h2>Chapter I: Which Treats of the Character and Pursuits of the Famous Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha</h2>
        <p class="sample_paragraph">In a village in La Mancha, the name of which I don't care to recall, there lived not long ago
          one of those hidalgos who keep a lance in a rack, an ancient leather shield, and a greyhound for
          coursing. A midday stew with rather more shin of beef than leg of mutton, the leftovers for supper
          most nights, lardy eggs on Saturdays, lentil broth on Fridays, and an occasional pigeon as a Sunday
          treat ate up three quarters of his income.
        </p>
        <p class="sample_paragraph">
          The rest of it went toward a cape of fine broadcloth and velvet breeches and slippers to match for
          holy days, and on weekdays he walked proudly in his finest homespun. He maintained a housekeeper the
          wrong side of forty, a niece the right side of twenty, and a jack of all trades who was as good at
          saddling the nag as at plying the pruning shears. Our hidalgo himself was nearly fifty; he had a robust
          constitution, dried up flesh and a withered face, and he was an early riser and keen huntsman. His surname's
          said to have been Quixada or Quesada (as if he were a jawbone or a cheesecake): conerning this detail,
          there's some discrepancy among the authors who have written on the subject, although a credible conjecture
          does suggest he might have been a plaintative Quexana. But this doesn't matter much as far as the story is
          concerned, provided that the narrator doesn't stray one inch from the truth.
