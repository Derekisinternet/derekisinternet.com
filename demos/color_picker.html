      <p class="sample_paragraph">In a village in La Mancha, the name of which I don't care to recall, there lived not long ago
         one of those hidalgos who keep a lance in a rack, an ancient leather shield, and a greyhound for
         coursing. A midday stew with rather more shin of beef than leg of mutton, the leftovers for supper
         most nights, lardy eggs on Saturdays, lentil broth on Fridays, and an occasional pigeon as a Sunday
         treat ate up three quarters of his income.

        The rest of it went toward a cape of fine broadcloth and velvet breeches and slippers to match for
         holy days, and on weekdays he walked proudly in his finest homespun. He maintained a housekeeper the
         wrong side of forty, a niece the right side of twenty, and a jack of all trades who was as good at
         saddling the nag as at plying the pruning shears. Our hidalgo himself was nearly fifty; he had a robust
         constitution, dried up flesh and a withered face, and he was an early riser and keen huntsman. His surname's
         said to have been Quixada or Quesada (as if he were a jawbone or a cheesecake): conerning this detail,
         there's some discrepancy among the authors who have written on the subject, although a credible conjecture
         does suggest he might have been a plaintative Quexana. But this doesn't matter much as far as the story is
         concerned, provided that the narrator doesn't stray one inch from the truth.
